# SuperBenefit

**Developing the social and financial flywheels that enable the invention and acceleration of a better world.**

SuperBenefit is a DAO researching and incubating initiatives that harness web3 technologies—DAOs, NFTs, DeFi—in pursuit of systems transformation. We're building the coordination infrastructure for a future of universal abundance.

## What We Do

🔬 **Research** — Exploring governance patterns, DAO primitives, and decentralized coordination at scale

🌱 **Incubate** — Supporting projects that demonstrate web3's potential for systemic change

📚 **Share** — Publishing open knowledge through our [Knowledge Garden](https://knowledge.superbenefit.org) and [Mirror](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz)

🤝 **Connect** — Building bridges between web3 innovators and organizations working toward better futures

## Active Projects

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**All in For Sport**](https://allinforsport.org) | Perpetual funding mechanism for community sports globally |
| [**DAO Primitives**](https://superbenefit.org/dao-primitive-project) | Governance design patterns for scalable, purpose-driven networks |
| [**Reimagining Power**](https://knowledge.superbenefit.org) | Explorations in emerging tech adoption for more equitable social impact outcomes.

## Our Approach

We organize as a network of **Cells**—small, autonomous teams pursuing specific purposes while connected to our shared mission. This fractal structure allows us to scale coordination without sacrificing the creativity and agility of small groups.
